# Lets-camp

To the iteration team: 

Features we wanted to implement on top of what we already have include: 

-integrating a weatherAPI to display live weather data for our already favorited locations. 
-integrating a darksitefinder API to display which of our campgrounds are good stargazing sites
-fixing our add favorite functionality
-creating a button to submit our favorites on the results page after querying our API.
-fixing our queryAPI functionality. currently the string we send to the API doesn't grab all the amenities we want to grab, we believe we're only grabbing the first amenity that follows state. eg: only pets allowed data
-displaying our current favorites on a map
-bcrypt
-cookies for persistent login
-sessions on database side to facilitate persistent login
-adding a hashed userID to each user so that we can send a hash back to the frontend instead of a userID that's just an autoincremented integer.

We probably missed a ton of stuff in comments. Don't hesitate to reach out to us if something isn't clear. 

Team Squirtle.
Good luck!
